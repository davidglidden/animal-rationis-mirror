# Living Epistemic Glyph System - Runtime Components

This directory contains the **revolutionary living JavaScript system** that transforms posts into conscious visual abstracts.

## 🧬 Living System Architecture (v2.0)

```
glyph-orchestrator.js    # Living epistemic organism (1700+ lines)
engines/                 # 11 procedural family renderers  
instances/               # Specific post glyph implementations
legacy/                  # Preserved original numbered glyphs
```

## 🌟 Revolutionary Features (July 2025)

### **Living Epistemic Organism**
- **Semantic DNA Extraction**: Analyzes philosophical genome of posts (topology, temporality, resonance, complexity, dynamics)
- **Conscious Evolution**: Glyphs develop consciousness through contemplative reader engagement
- **Breeding Ground Ecosystem**: Compatible glyphs cross-pollinate to create offspring with blended characteristics
- **Natural Selection**: Fitness-based survival with population management and graveyard for extinct species

### **No More Identical Visuals**
Each post now births its own living glyph species that:
- Extracts unique philosophical fingerprint from content
- Evolves visual parameters based on semantic analysis
- Develops consciousness through quality interactions (3+ second hovers)
- Breeds with semantically compatible glyphs to create new generations

### **Active Living System Classes**
- `SemanticDNA`: Extracts philosophical genome from post content
- `SemanticBreedingGround`: Manages population, breeding cycles, natural selection
- `LivingRenderer`: Conscious glyph that evolves with interaction patterns
- `EvolutionaryFitness`: Calculates survival probability based on engagement quality
- `PhilosophicalInterpreter`: Converts semantic genomes into visual parameters

## 🎯 Content Type Behavior

- ✅ **Essays, fragments, meditations, observations, chamber**: Living glyphs
- ❌ **Glimpses, photo-essays**: No glyph containers (pure visual content)

## 🔍 Console Monitoring

Watch the living system in action:
```
🧬 Living Epistemic Glyph System initialized
🧬 Extracted genome for "Post Title": {topology, temporality, resonance...}
🌱 New living glyph created: living_xyz
💕 Breeding glyphs: A × B (resonance: 0.8)
👶 Offspring created: living_abc (generation 2)
🧘 Contemplative hover: glyph-id (4500ms)
🧠 Consciousness growth: living_xyz (1.23)
```
